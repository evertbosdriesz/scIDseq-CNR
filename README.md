# Analysis code for "Cell-state specific drug-responses are associated with differences in signaling network wiring"

Data and code relating to the manuscript "Cell-state specific drug-responses are associated with differences in signaling network wiring" Niels Kr√§mer, Roderick van Eijl, Tim Stohn, Sabine Tanis, Lodewyk Wessels, Evert Bosdriesz, and Klaas W. Mulder

## What's where?

* Raw and processed data can be found in the "data" folder.
* Analyses relating to pathway scores cell-state clustering (roughly, Figs 1&2) can be found in the "cell-state-clustering" folder.
* Analyses relating to cell state dependent drug response and signal transduction (roughly, Figs 3&4) can be found in the "cell-state-analysis" folder. The scCNR methods required for the analysis in Fig 4 can be downloaded here: https://github.com/ibivu/scmra 
* Boxplots for the abundance of all (phospho-)proteins, either per cell state or of the whole population, can be found in the "ab-profiles" folder.
